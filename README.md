Term Project Proposal: Personal Finance Management System
Introduction
Managing personal finances effectively is crucial for achieving financial stability and meeting long-term goals. The Personal Finance Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to help users track their income and expenses, maintain budgets, and gain insightful visualizations of their financial activities. This system allows users to store transaction records, categorize expenses, and provide a clear comparison between actual spending and budgeted goals. Built using fundamental programming concepts such as selection, looping, arrays, file I/O, and exception handling—alongside a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI)—the system offers an efficient and intuitive platform for personal financial management.

Key Features
1. Object-Oriented Programming
The system is built using object-oriented principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

Transaction Class
Purpose: Manages details of individual financial transactions, including income and expenses.
Attributes: Transaction ID, amount, date, category, description.
Methods: Getters and setters, transaction validation, categorization.
User Class
Purpose: Stores and manages user information and budget goals.
Attributes: User ID, name, email, password, budget goals.
Methods: User authentication, profile management, budget setting.
Budget Class
Purpose: Calculates and monitors the remaining budget based on total expenses.
Attributes: Total budget, total expenses, remaining budget.
Methods: Budget calculations, budget updates, budget alerts.
2. Selection and Looping
The system employs selection statements (if-else, switch-case) and looping constructs (for, while) to handle user inputs and process multiple transactions efficiently.

Transaction Input: Allows users to input multiple transactions with validation checks.
Budget Calculation: Iterates through transaction history to compute total expenses.
Category Management: Uses loops to categorize and summarize expenses.
3. Arrays
Arrays are used to store and manage transaction data and categorize expenses, providing an organized view of the user's financial activities.

Transaction Array: Stores all transaction objects.
Category Array: Maintains predefined categories for expenses (e.g., Food, Utilities, Entertainment).
Dynamic Allocation: Allows for scalable storage and easy access to transaction data.
4. File I/O
The system incorporates file input/output operations to persist user data and transaction history.

Data Storage: Saves transaction records and user information to files.
Data Retrieval: Loads existing transaction history and user profiles upon startup.
Report Generation: Creates comprehensive reports based on expense categories and budget status.
5. Exception Processing
Robust exception handling ensures the system can gracefully manage unexpected scenarios and invalid inputs.

Input Validation: Handles incorrect data entries and prompts users for correct information.
File Handling: Manages missing or corrupted files, ensuring data integrity.
Runtime Errors: Catches and logs exceptions to prevent system crashes.
6. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
A user-friendly GUI enhances the overall user experience, making the application accessible and easy to navigate.

Dashboard: Provides an overview of financial status, including total income, expenses, and budget remaining.
Transaction Management: Interfaces for adding, editing, and viewing transactions.
Budget Setup: Allows users to set and modify budget goals.
Data Visualization: Incorporates charts and graphs to visualize spending patterns and budget adherence.
Internal Documentation
Comprehensive internal documentation is integrated into the codebase to facilitate understanding and maintenance. Key aspects include:

Class Documentation: Detailed descriptions of each class, including purpose, attributes, and methods.
Method Comments: Explanations of method functionalities, input parameters, and return values.
Variable Descriptions: Clear descriptions of variables and their roles within the program.
Routine Explanations: Insights into complex algorithms and logic implementations, particularly within budget calculations and data processing modules.
User Guide
A detailed user guide will assist users in navigating and utilizing the Personal Finance Management System effectively. The guide covers:

Getting Started: Installation instructions and initial setup procedures.
Adding Transactions: Step-by-step instructions for inputting income and expenses.
Setting Budget Goals: Guidelines for establishing and adjusting budgetary limits.
Generating Reports: Instructions for accessing and interpreting financial reports.
Navigating the Interface: Overview of the GUI components and their functionalities.
Troubleshooting: Solutions to common issues and FAQs.
